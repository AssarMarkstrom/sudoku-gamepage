                    <h2>Game Rules</h2>

                    <p>Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits
                        so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also
                        called "boxes" or "blocks") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzler provides a
                        partially completed grid based on the chosen game difficulty.</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Sudoku puzzles originated in Switzerland in the 18th century. However, the modern version of
                        Sudoku was designed by Howard Garns and first published in 1979 under the name "Number Place".
                        It became popular in Japan in the 1980s and gained international popularity in the early 2000s.

                    <h2>Sudoku Tips</h2>
                    <p>Sudoku can be both enjoyable and intimidating for beginners. Here are some tips to enhance your
                        Sudoku skills:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Identify rows, columns, or 3x3 sections with 5 or more numbers.
                                Fill in empty cells with remaining numbers, considering existing placements for unique
                                solutions.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Mentally divide the grid into 3 columns and 3 rows. Look for
                                duplicate numbers in columns or grids to deduce missing numbers in the remaining
                                section.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now, armed with these tips, start solving some sudoku!</p>
